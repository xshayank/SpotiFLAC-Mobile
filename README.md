## Search Source

SpotiFLAC supports multiple search sources for finding music metadata:

| Source | Setup |
|--------|-------|
| **Deezer** (Default) | No setup required |
| **Extensions** | Install additional search providers from the Store |

## Extensions

Extensions allow the community to add new music sources and features without waiting for app updates. When a streaming service API changes or a new source becomes available, extensions can be updated independently.

### Installing Extensions
1. Go to **Store** tab in the app
2. Browse and install extensions with one tap
3. Or download a `.spotiflac-ext` file and install manually via **Settings > Extensions**
4. Configure extension settings if needed
5. Set provider priority in **Settings > Extensions > Provider Priority**

### Developing Extensions
Want to create your own extension? Check out the [Extension Development Guide](https://zarz.moe/docs) for complete documentation.

## FAQ

**Q: Why is my download failing with "Song not found"?**  
A: The track may not be available on Tidal, Qobuz, or Amazon Music. Try enabling more download services in Settings > Download > Provider Priority, or install additional extensions from the Store.

**Q: Why are some tracks downloading in lower quality?**  
A: Quality depends on what's available from the streaming service. Tidal offers up to 24-bit/192kHz, Qobuz up to 24-bit/192kHz, and Amazon up to 24-bit/48kHz. The app automatically selects the best available quality.

**Q: Can I download playlists?**  
A: Yes! Just paste the playlist URL in the search bar. The app will fetch all tracks and queue them for download.

**Q: Why do I need to grant storage permission?**  
A: The app needs permission to save downloaded files to your device. On Android 13+, you may need to grant "All files access" in Settings > Apps > SpotiFLAC > Permissions.

**Q: Why is the mobile app so large (~50MB) compared to the PC version (~3MB)?**  
A: The mobile app includes FFmpeg libraries for audio processing and format conversion, which adds significant size. The PC version relies on system-installed FFmpeg, keeping the download smaller. We bundle FFmpeg to ensure compatibility across all Android devices without requiring users to install additional software.

**Q: Is this app safe?**  
A: Yes, the app is open source and you can verify the code yourself. Each release is scanned with VirusTotal (see badge at top of README).

**Q: How do I use proxy support?**  
A: Go to Settings > Network (or Advanced), enable "Use Proxy", and configure your proxy server (HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5). This is useful if your ISP blocks certain services or you need to route traffic through a proxy.

**Q: Does the Windows version work the same as mobile?**  
A: Yes! The Windows version is built from the same codebase and has all the same features. See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions on building the Windows version.

**Q: How do I build the Windows version?**  
A: Follow the instructions in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). You'll need Flutter SDK, Go, and Visual Studio with C++ tools. Run `scripts/build_windows.bat` on Windows or see the manual build steps in the documentation.
